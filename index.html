											<h1>Hi, I’m Francisco</h1>
											<p>Post-doctoral Scholar <br />
											University of California, Los Angeles

										</header>
										<p>Dr. Francisco Spaulding-Astudillo is a geophysicist
											and specializes in the study of climate, 
											clouds, and convection on Earth and other celestial bodies. 
											In his research, he leverages fundamental theories such as thermodynamics, 
											fluid dynamics, and radiative transfer to make predictions. 
											These predictions are rigorously tested using state-of-the-art numerical 
											simulations and are then compared against real-world observations. 
											Currently, his research aims to achieve three key objectives:
											<ul>
												<li> disentangle the radiative and thermodynamic impacts of water vapor 
													on the formation of tropical congestus clouds;
												<li> identify potential climate tipping points resulting from greenhouse gas emissions;
												<li> explain alterations in storm dynamics, frequency, 
													 and precipitation under high-temperature and/or high-moisture conditions.

											<h3>The origin of tropical congestus clouds</h3>
											<p>
												Congestus clouds are one of the 3 major cloud populations in the tropics 
												and are particularly important in the context of the local climate, 
												producing 25-40% of the total precipitation. 
												On average, congestus clouds reach heights of 5-6 km, 
												and therefore are the “middle child” with respect to 
												their smaller sibling the fair-weather cumulus cloud 
												and their larger sibling the stormy cumulonimbus cloud. 
												As lead author of a newly submitted study, we show that the 
												height at which congestus cloud tops form is directly 
												related to the ability of the atmosphere to radiatively cool.

											<h3>Relaxation-oscillator convection on Earth and Titan</h3>
											<p>
												The global-mean precipitation rate on Earth today is remarkably steady, 
												indicating that moist convection – that is, air motion involving 
												the condensation of water – is an ongoing process across the globe. 
												If the Earth were 30 Celsius warmer, the weather would oscillate 
												between intense downpours and quiescent, dry periods. 
												Like a metronome, the storms that bring the torrential rains would 
												materialize and dissipate at regular intervals. 
												As lead author of a new study (in revision at <i>PSJ</i>), we show 
												that the critical temperature at which these oscillating 
												storms erupt is predicted by the breakdown of a thermodynamic heat engine 
												(not unlike the one in your car) model of convection.

											<h3>Effects of saturation vapor pressure on climate, clouds, and convection</h3>
											<p>
												One might reasonably expect that a planet 
												with more moisture in its atmosphere would 
												have more clouds. This assumption is 
												contradicted by Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. 
												Titan’s atmosphere is of a comparable density to 
												Earth’s and composed primarily of nitrogen. 
												Earth and Titan are the only two bodies in 
												the solar system where it rains at the surface. 
												Titan is so cold that the substance that forms 
												clouds and precipitation on Titan is methane 
												(commonly known as natural gas). 
												Titan also stores over 100 times 
												more “moisture” in its atmosphere than Earth. 
												Despite this, clouds cover less than 1% of 
												Titan’s surface in the annual-mean 
												(the same statistic is close to 70% for Earth). 
												These observations of Earth and Titan motivated 
												a comparative study 
												of the effects of moisture on climate.

										<h2 id="content">Motivation</h2>
										<p>
											One might reasonably expect that a planet with more moisture 
											in its atmosphere would have more clouds. However, this 
											assumption is contradicted by Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. 
											Titan's atmosphere, comparable in density to Earth's, is also primarily 
											composed of nitrogen. Earth and Titan stand out as the only 
											two bodies in the solar system where it rains at the surface, 
											with liquids forming rivers and seas. The substance responsible 
											for cloud formation and precipitation on Titan is methane, commonly 
											known as natural gas, due to the moon's extreme cold. 
											Titan stores over 100 times more "moisture" in its atmosphere 
											than Earth, mainly because methane's saturation vapor pressure 
											is significantly higher at -180°C compared to water vapor at 15°C.
											Clouds cover less than 1% of Titan's surface on an annual 
											average (one year on Titan corresponds to 16 years on Earth), 
											in stark contrast to Earth's 70%. This intriguing aspect of 
											Titan motivated us to conduct a comparative study, 
											investigating the impact of varying saturation vapor 
											pressure on the climate and cloud formation of 
											an ``Earth-like” planet. Using Earth as the reference 
											state, we ran a series of simulations with a climate model 
											to better understand the role of moisture. 

											\[e^*(\xi,T) = \xi e(T)  \]

											To determine the modified vapor pressure of water \(e^*\), 
											we scale the true saturation vapor pressure of water \(e\), 
											a function solely dependent on temperature \(T\), by a constant \(0\leq &#958 \leq 2\). 
											This range of \(\xi\) is chosen because the vapor pressure of methane 
											on Titan is several times higher than water on Earth. 
											A value of \(\xi=0\) corresponds to a simulation of an Earth-like 
											atmosphere entirely devoid of water. Conversely, for \(\xi=2\), 
											the simulation is configured to mimic an Earth-like atmosphere 
											with a vapor pressure twice as high, leading to conditions 
											rich in vapor. This approach allows us to explore a 
											spectrum of scenarios, adjusting the vapor pressure to 
											study varying levels of water presence in the atmosphere.
										</p>

										<h2 id="content">Cloud height</h2>
										<p>
											Exploring different water vapor pressures led to an intriguing observation 
											regarding cloud heights. Earth's troposphere, often referred to as the weather layer, 
											forms clouds at three distinct altitudes classified as low-level, mid-level, 
											and upper-level. Our climate model, like many others that use 
											humidity-based parameterizations, could effectively capture only 
											low-level and upper-level clouds. Click <a href="congestus.html">here</a>
											 to delve into my research 
											on mid-level "congestus clouds". As vapor pressure increased, we observed 
											a descent in low-level clouds and a simultaneous ascent in upper-level clouds.

												<h3>Low clouds get lower</h3>
												<p>
													To explain why high clouds ascend with increasing vapor pressure, 
													we turned to a well-established theory that cloud tops form where 
													there are strong vertical decreases in the radiative cooling rate. 
													The cooling rate, in turn, depends on the molecules in the atmosphere 
													that absorb and emit infrared radiation, also known as greenhouse gases. 
													The most important greenhouse gas in Earth’s atmosphere is, of course, 
													water vapor. Therefore, the absorption lines of water vapor tell an 
													important story about the locations of clouds and how they 
													respond to various forcings.  
													<br><br>
													Using basic principles of radiative transfer, 
													we showed that high clouds form at a constant vapor 
													path in Earth-like climates. The vapor 
													path is so-defined as a path integral of the vapor pressure 
													downwards from the top of the atmosphere to some 
													arbitrary height \( z\). As \(\xi \) increases, more 
													water vapor exists at each height of the atmosphere, 
													and this moves the absorption and emission to higher altitudes, 
													thus shifting the clouds upward. 	
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>High clouds get higher</h3>
												<p>
													To shed light on the descent of low clouds, 
													we employed a model focused on the boundary 
													layer height. The turbulence in this layer 
													transports moisture from the surface to the condensation level, 
													playing a crucial role in cloud formation. 
													Our investigation revealed a corresponding decline 
													in the boundary layer height linked to the rise in 
													tropospheric static stability.
													<br><br>
													The atmospheric stability increases as a consequence of 
													higher concentrations of water vapor. This occurs because 
													the convecting regions experience a slower temperature 
													decrease with height, attributed to the release of latent heat. 
													In an environment marked by increased stability, 
													boundary layer turbulence is confined closer to the surface, 
													compelling the low clouds to descend.

										<h3> Tipping points in cloud formation </h3>
										<p>
											We found evidence for two transitions in cloud formation
											with increasing \(\xi \). 
											We explored these transitions in terms of instability parameters 
											that represent the conditions over which certain cloud types should form. 
											In short, we found that low clouds and high clouds <i>merge</i> when the atmosphere is sufficiently 
											dry (because boundary layer turbulence homogenizes the vertical profile 
											of relative humidity on which the model bases cloud droplet growth) 
											and that low clouds <i>disappear</i> when the atmosphere is 
											sufficiently wet (because boundary layer turbulence cannot 
											lift moisture to the condensation level, which is essential 
											for the clouds to persist).

											Schematic illustration of our varying-\(\xi \) simulations. 
											At intermediate values of \(\xi \), Group 2 (G2) climates
											are the most ``Earth-like" with well-separated clouds at low and high levels. 
											At low \(\xi \), Group 1 (G1) climates are vapor-poor with a single cloud layer.
											At high \(\xi \), Group 3 (G3) climates are vapor-rich and the most ``Titan-like" with 
											several meters of precipitable water in their atmospheres. 
											In Earth-like climates, we find that high clouds get higher and low clouds get lower
											with increasing \(\xi \).

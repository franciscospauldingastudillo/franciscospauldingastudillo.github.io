										<h1>The emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection 
											on Earth and Titan
										</h1>
									</header>

									<p> 
									Earth, Titan, and the “hothouse” Earth represent 
									three distinct planetary environments, 
									each characterized by unique conditions and 
									atmospheric compositions. Earth has a life-supporting atmosphere 
									primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen. 
									The atmosphere of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is 
									similar to Earth’s in that it is rich in nitrogen but, 
									on Titan, it rains methane instead of water. Due to its 
									distance from the sun, Titan experiences extremely low 
									temperatures. And yet, there is over 100 times more 
									precipitable methane in Titan’s atmosphere than 
									precipitable water in Earth’s. This can be understood
									by the fact that methane is more volatile than water. 
									While Earth may be regarded as an ocean planet, 
									Titan is, for the most part, an arid desert with 
									methane lakes and rivers at its poles. 
									The term "hothouse” Earth is a concept referring 
									to a hypothetical state of our planet characterized 
									by significantly elevated temperatures, driven by increased 
									concentrations of greenhouse gases. This scenario, 
									often discussed in the context of climate change, 
									represents a catastrophic consequence of alterations to 
									Earth’s atmospheric composition with implications 
									for the climate, clouds, and precipitation. 
									Each of these realms — Earth, Titan, and the 
									hothouse Earth — offers valuable insights into 
									atmospheric dynamics, climate processes, and 
									the conditions necessary for life.

									<h3>Precipitation</h3>

									<p>
										Comparison of the global-mean precipitation on Earth and Titan (above) 
										reveals a fascinating dichotomy. Precipitation on Earth 
										is steady and continuous, reflecting the fact that moist convection
										- that is, convection involving the condensation of water - 
										is persistently ongoing. Titan, on the other hand, 
					                    is non-precipitating most of the time. Precipitating storms on Titan 
										are intense and short-lived and reoccur at semi-regular intervals.
										This unique weather produces Titan's distinct pattern of precipitation (middle plot)
										that resembles the waveform of a relaxed oscillator. 
										It was recently revealed that there is an <i>emergent dynamical similarity</i>
										with respect to precipitation between Titan and the hothouse Earth. 
										In other words, the precipitation on Earth becomes Titan-like
										at very high surface temperatures. The mechanism underlying the transition in precipitation
										patterns is currently debated.

									<h2>Convection is a natural "heat engine" </h2>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/engine.gif" alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										Convection operates as a natural heat engine due to the 
										fundamental principles of thermodynamics governing the 
										movement of heat within fluids. When a fluid, such as 
										air or water, is heated, it becomes less dense and 
										tends to rise, creating an upward flow of warm material. 
										As this warm fluid ascends, it releases heat to the 
										surrounding environment. At higher altitudes, the fluid cools, 
										becomes denser, and descends back towards the heat source to 
										complete the cycle. This continuous process of rising, 
										cooling, descending, and reheating produces an overturning circulation. 
										The movement of the fluid transforms heat energy into 
										mechanical energy, and thus exhibits a natural heat engine-like behavior. 
									</p>

									<p> 
										
										In my new study, we demonstrate that, in order for a convective heat engine 
										to operate in steady-state equilibrium, the heat transported by 
										convection must be less than the work performed by the engine. 
										This simple statement emerges from two assumptions: (1) the entropy 
										budget in equilibrium reflects a balance between radiative processes 
										and turbulent dissipation of kinetic energy; (2) convection must 
										transport enough heat to offset atmospheric cooling to space.

									<h2>The importance of oscillating convection</h2>
									<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/infinite-RO.gif" alt="" /></span>
										Oscillating convection is a new frontier of fluid dynamics
										in planetary atmospheres. By determining the factors
										that lead to tipping points between precipitation regimes,
										we stand to gain new insights into the workings
										of our current climate. Understanding the driving factors of precipitation 
										is crucial for various aspects of climate science, hydrology, and 
										environmental planning. Precipitation plays a pivotal role in 
										Earth's water cycle, influencing water availability, 
										ecosystems, and human activities. While mean precipitation 
										provides insight into long-term climate trends and helps 
										identify regions that are susceptible to weather extremes, precipitation intensity
										quantifies the potential impact of extreme weather events 
										such as heavy storms or prolonged periods of drought. 
										More needs to be done to understand how these quantities change 
										with significant surface warming as this information is essential for infrastructure planning, 
										flood management, and understanding the implications of climate change.

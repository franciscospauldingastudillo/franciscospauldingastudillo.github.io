										<h1>The origin of tropical congestus clouds</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/congestus.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p> 
										Cumulus, congestus, and cumulonimbus clouds are distinct cloud types, 
										each playing a role in the Earth's atmospheric processes and 
										contributing to different weather phenomena. These clouds are categorized 
										based on their appearance, altitude, and the atmospheric conditions 
										associated with them. In this image, we see a convective system consisting of
									    shallow cumulus and a precipitating congestus tower (center). 
									</p>

									<h3>Cumulus Clouds</h3>

									<p> Cumulus clouds are perhaps the most recognizable among the three. 
										They are generally white, puffy clouds with a flat base. 
										Cumulus clouds form when warm air rises and cools, 
										causing water vapor to condense into droplets. 
										While cumulus clouds are typically benign and indicate fair weather, 
										they can develop into more significant 
										cloud types under certain conditions.
									</p>
									<h3>Congestus Clouds</h3>

									<p> Congestus clouds are an intermediate stage between cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds. 
										These clouds appear larger and taller than typical cumulus clouds 
										and often have a well-defined vertical development. 
										Congestus clouds indicate rising air currents and 
										increasing atmospheric instability. While they are still generally 
										associated with fair weather, their towering appearance suggests a potential 
										for further development into more intense cloud formations.
									</p>
									<h3>Cumulonimbus Clouds</h3>

									<p> Cumulonimbus clouds are the most dramatic and powerful 
										of the three types. These towering clouds can reach the 
										stratosphere and are associated with thunderstorms, 
										heavy rainfall, lightning, and gusty winds. 
										Cumulonimbus clouds have a characteristic anvil-shaped top 
										caused by the spreading of the cloud at the tropopause. 
										These clouds are capable of producing severe weather 
										due to strong updrafts and the potential for organized 
										convection.

									<h2>Convection is an "elevator" for cloudy air </h2>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/elevator.gif" alt="" /></span>

									<p>
										Convection acts as an "elevator" for cloudy air by 
										facilitating the vertical movement of air masses within the Earth's atmosphere. 
										When the sun heats the Earth's surface, the air in contact with the warm ground 
										becomes warmer and less dense. As this warm air rises, it cools adiabatically, 
										and if it reaches its dew point, water vapor within it condenses to form clouds. 
										This rising motion of air, driven by temperature and density differences, is known as convection. 
										Essentially, convection serves as an atmospheric elevator, lifting moist air parcels to 
										higher altitudes where the cooling and condensation processes occur, 
										leading to the formation of clouds. This vertical transport of air is crucial 
										for the redistribution of heat and moisture throughout the atmosphere, 
										playing a fundamental role in weather patterns and the development of shallow cumulus, 
										intermediate congestus, and deep cumulonimbus.
									</p>

									<p>
										The relationship between cloud area, radiative impact, and cloud spreading 
										is integral to understanding the influence of clouds on Earth's 
										energy balance. Cloud area refers to the spatial coverage of 
										clouds in a given region, impacting the amount of 
										solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface and 
										the longwave radiation escaping back into space. 
										The radiative impact of clouds involves their ability to 
										reflect incoming solar radiation (albedo effect) and 
										trap outgoing terrestrial radiation (greenhouse effect). 
										
										Cloud spreading, or the horizontal extent of clouds, plays a 
										crucial role in determining the overall radiative impact. In a recently submitted paper, 
										we show that congestus clouds form at 5-6 km altitude due to cloud spreading associated
										with air "exiting" - that is, detraining - from convective elevators. 
										Cloudy air preferentially detrains from the convective elevator 
										at 5-6 km due to vertical gradients in the clear-sky cooling rate.
										The simplest explanation for this is that atmospheric cooling gradients
										act as a "vacuum" for cloudy air, which must be supplied by the elevators.

									<h2>The importance of congestus clouds</h2>
									<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/agu2023.JPG" alt="" /></span>
										Congestus clouds are a topic of considerable interest to the scientific community. 
										They supply 25-40% of total tropical precipitation, and therefore have an important hydrological
										as well as economic impact (on, e.g., agriculture and financial assets). Unfortunately, most re-analysis models severely under-estimate their 
										abundance, which are well known from satellite observations. These models are widely used by researchers
										in academia and industry (e.g., insurance and finance) to quantify climate risk. Clouds remain the largest
										source of uncertainty in predicting future climate change. The tropics are an ideal laboratory for testing
										ideas about cloud formation, especially mid-level congestus, which are understudied
										compared to the cumulus and cumulonimbus populations due to . Recently, I had the pleasure of giving a talk
										about the origin of congestus clouds at the 2023 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco.
